Unfortunately, you have to cut them yourself ‚úÇÔ∏èüòä. You can set how many cards you need fit to one page base on your needs. You can change following variables using the command line parameters:
- `-t` or `--target_language`: Language you are going to learn. Any language supported by google translate is supported. however, I cannot guarantee the quality of the translation, as it is done by a robot. To learn available codes go to https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/languages
  - Example: `-t fr`
  - Default: `--target_language en`
- `-s` or `--source_language`: Language you know, file \lemmas\lemmas_<lang_code>.txt is expected. You can create the file manually if you have certain words you wanna learn in mind or you can use/edit lemmas provided fo "cs" or "en" languages. They contain most used words in both provided languages.
    - Example: `-s en`
    - Default: `--source_language cs`
- `-r` or `--rows`: Number of rows on one page. 6 is recommended to have card about 5cm or 2 inches in height.
    - Example: `-r 4`
    - Default: `--rows 6`
- `-c` or `--cols`: Number of columns on one page. 4 is recommended to have card about 5cm or 2 inches in height.
    - Example: `-c 3`
    - Default: `--cols 4`
- `-w` or `--word_count`: Number of words to be generated. To not waste paper, number of words will be rounded up to fully cover all pages.
    - Example: `-w 2000`
    - Default: `--word_count 250`
## TODO:
- Functionality for custom fonts.
